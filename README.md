# Roll-a-ballMod

A little game where you're a ball collecting squares.
This version adds a timer and you need to get all the collectables before time runs out.
If you successfully get them all it displays "You Win!"
If you don't get them all it displays "You Lose!" and you will no longer be able to pick up the collectables.
